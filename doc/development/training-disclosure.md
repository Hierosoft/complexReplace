# Training Disclosure for Complex Replace
This Training Disclosure, which may be more specifically titled above here (and in this document possibly referred to as "this disclosure"), is based on **Training Disclosure version 1.1.4** at https://github.com/Hierosoft/training-disclosure by Jake Gustafson. Jake Gustafson is probably *not* an author of the project unless listed as a project author, nor necessarily the disclosure editor(s) of this copy of the disclosure unless this copy is the original which among other places I, Jake Gustafson, state IANAL. The original disclosure is released under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license, but regarding any text that differs from the original:

This disclosure also functions as a claim of copyright to the scope described in the paragraph below since potentially in some jurisdictions output not of direct human origin, by certain means of generation at least, may not be copyrightable (again, IANAL):

Various author(s) may make claims of authorship to content in the project not mentioned in this disclosure, which this disclosure by way of omission unless stated elsewhere implies is of direct human origin unless stated elsewhere. Such statements elsewhere are present and complete if applicable to the best of the disclosure editor(s) ability. Additionally, the project author(s) hereby claim copyright and claim direct human origin to any and all content in the subsections of this disclosure itself, where scope is defined to the best of the ability of the disclosure editor(s), including the subsection names themselves, unless where stated, and unless implied such as by context, being copyrighted or trademarked elsewhere, or other means of statement or implication according to law in applicable jurisdiction(s).

This disclosure is a voluntary of how and where content in or used by this project was produced by LLM(s) or any tools that are "trained" in any way.

The main section of this disclosure lists such tools. For each, the version, install location, and a scope of their training sources in a way that is specific as possible.

Subsections of this disclosure contain prompts used to generate content, in a way that is complete to the best ability of the disclosure editor(s).

tool(s) used:
- GPT-4-Turbo (Version 4o, chatgpt.com)

Scope of use: code described in subsections--typically modified by hand to improve logic, variable naming, integration, etc.

## extension.js, package.json, .gitignore README.md, .vscode/launch.json

- .gitignore is based on GitHub's Node.js gitignore but with the LLM's lines added that were not already present.

create a visual studio code extension that has three settings: cast_string (string, default "bytearray" ) and cast_syntax (enum, "call" (default), "C") and bool extra_parenthesis (default true). And whenever the user hits Alt+B the script casts the selection to the given type. For example, if the user selects [0x01, 0x04] and then presses Alt+B and the, the selection is edited to bytearray([0x01, 0x04]) but if te cast_syntax setting is "C" then it is changed to (bytearray)[0x01, 0x04] or if C and extra_parenthesis is true then (bytearray)([0x01, 0x04]). In the case of cast_syntax "call", the extra parenthesis setting is ignored (because parenthesis is always added for a call). Try to not get confused with what I am saying--I am talking about editing literal code, so [0x01, 0x04] should not be anywhere in the code of the extension, it is just an example of what the user may have selected, and the extension should add text before the beginning of the user's selection, and a parenthesis after the user's selection in the cases I've described.

what should the folder and file structure be?

what is the gitignore for a visual studio code extension? Is there one in github.com/gitignore that should be used, or one from microsoft, or what?

Ok, change and/or add metadata indicating the name of the extension is complexReplace by Hierosoft LLC and the source code and website is https://github.com/Hierosoft/complexReplace (report issues at https://github.com/Hierosoft/complexReplace/issues)

Can I add a hotkey for the command in the extension code or extension package metadata itself or how can I do so in visual studio code?
